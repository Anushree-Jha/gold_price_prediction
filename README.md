# gold_price_prediction
Gold Price Prediction is a machine learning project designed to forecast the price of gold using historical data and advanced predictive modeling techniques. Leveraging Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas.
Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the price of gold using machine learning algorithms. Gold prices are influenced by various factors such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to develop predictive models that can forecast future gold prices with high accuracy.

Key Features:

Utilizes historical gold price data for model training.
Implements various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Provides interactive visualizations to analyze gold price trends and model predictions.
Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
